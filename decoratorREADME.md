-What are decorators in Python?
 Decorators are Python functions that allow you to wrap another function as an input and modify itsbehavior without altering the wrapped functionâ€™s code. They are used to extend the behavior of a particular object, such as a class, method, or function. This approach promotes reusability, modularity, and separation of concerns in your Python programs.


-How to write a decorator in Python?
 Now that you know the basics of decorators, let's look at how to write a simple decorator in Python.

 Step-by-step explanation
 1-Define a higher-order function that takes a function as input.
 2-Inside this higher-order function, define a nested function (a wrapper) that will modify or extend the input function's behavior.
 3-Call the input function within the wrapper function and add any additional functionality you desire.
 4-Return the wrapper function from the higher-order function
 
 
Here are some commonly used decorators in Python with Selenium and Pytest:

 *@pytest.mark.parametrize: This decorator allows a test function to be called multiple times with different parameters. It's useful for testing the same test code with different inputs.

 *@pytest.fixture: This decorator defines a function to be run before a test function or a test file. It can be used to set up conditions such as initializing a browser or preparing a specific state.
  
 *@pytest.mark.skip: This decorator is used to temporarily skip a test. It can be used to prevent tests from running under certain conditions or for debugging purposes.    
 
 *@pytest.mark.xfail: This decorator is used when a test is expected to fail but the failure is temporary.

 *@pytest.mark.timeout: This decorator sets a maximum runtime for a test. If the test does not complete within the specified time, it times out and fails.

 *@pytest.mark.dependency: This decorator allows you to specify dependencies between tests, ensuring that certain tests are run before others. It helps in managing the order of test execution.
